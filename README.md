## webpack-proxy

You can define routes you want to proxy during development (e.g local mockes api-endpoints) by specifying them in `config/index.js` under `proxyTable` like this:

``` javascript
    proxyTable: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com',
        changeOrigin: true,
        pathRewrite: {
          '^/api': ''
        }
      }
    },

```
